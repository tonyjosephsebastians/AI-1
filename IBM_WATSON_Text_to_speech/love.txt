I know I am bad at expressing my love but I so want to do this.I know it's a bit silly, but I thought I'd try anyway.

You have had the most magical affect on my life. There was this feeling of inexplicable joy in my heart and I knew it at that moment that I needed to tell you just how much I love you. Forgive me, for I am not a writer, and may not know the best way and the best words to use. All I do know is that I love you and that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. So, all I ask of you is to continue loving me and I promise you that I shall do everything in my power to take care of you and love you till the end of time.

Be mine forever
